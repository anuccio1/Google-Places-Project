About: I used angular.js 1.4.4 to build this application. I wrote this using ES6 syntax, and have a grunt process that transpiles the code using Babel. 

Instructions to run this: 
	1) run "npm install" on the root to grab the npm packages (grunt)
	2) run "grunt" (this transpiles the code into a new file called main-built.js)
	3) open up index.html and everything should be good to go.
